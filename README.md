# JournalRankingIndex
<h3>An interactive table for displaying, filtering, searching, and ranking academic journals.</h3><br>

The Journal Ranking Index uses the <a href="https://datatables.net/">Datatables</a> JavaScript framework to create an interactive HTML table that is readily embedded on a webpage. 

Features beyond that provided by Datatables include:
  - A ranking column that remains static on sorting, filtering, and searching. 
  - Custom CSS to conditionally format table cells; making good metrics green, poor metrics red, etc.
  - Ranking metrics are distinguishable from classificatory metrics; journals are ordered by ranking metrics while classificatory metrics can be used to isolate a sub-set of journals to rank i.e. to rank only open-Access journals.

The current version is built for philosophy journals and the most prominent metrics used in the philosophical discipline.
